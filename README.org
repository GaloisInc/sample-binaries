* Sample Binaries

This repository provides a common set of simple sample binaries that
can be used for testing binary analysis functionality.  These binaries
don't tend to do anything particularly useful, but they do have
useful/interesting implementations.

Binaries are available for the following architectures:

  * ARM AArch32, ARM
  * ARM AArch32, Thumb
  * PPC 32
  * PPC 64
  * RISC-V
  * X86_64
